<span style="font-size: 13pt"><span style="color: #ff0000">Reconnaissance:</span><br/>
there are two type information gathering<span style="color: #000000">. <br/>
</span><span style="color: #000000">Passive : everything you don't touch directly relevant systems networks etc. is passive information gathering. Such as search on google or may be twitter pages, linkedin, maybe that is a picture of an employee or badge of company etc.<br/>
<br/>
Active: we scan directly the system or network. we can search open ports, vulnerabilities etc. in here we use tools -nmap etc.- that section also falls into scanning &amp; enumeration. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what returns in that active section we also perform enumeration. With this returns items we research vulnerabilities according to version for example.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000">Gaining Access: </span><span style="color: #000000">we will run exploit against the client or against the vulnerable service or whatever it may be to try to gain accessinto a machine or into a network into an environment etc.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #000000"><br/>
</span></span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 14pt">Once we have that access the process starts to repeat.<br/>
We do scanning an enumeration again and we also want to maintain that access.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000">Maintaining Access:</span><br/>
So if we were to get kicked out OK or a user shuts down their computer how do we maintain that access<br/>
and when they turn their computer back on we still have access to it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000">Covering Tracks:</span><br/>
And then lastly there is the covering tracks.<br/>
You want to delete any logs that you may leave behind you want to delete any kind of malware that you upload which is more important as a pen tester.<br/>
<br/>
Any accounts that you create for any reason you wanted delete those as well. You really just want to clean up is a good way of putting it.<br/>
<br/>
Covering tracks is the more hacker way of putting it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000">Note : </span>Regardless if you're doing network if you're doing web app or if you're doing a different type of assessment it's all similar in this five stages of hacking.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 14pt">The tools might change the attack methods might change but the overall methodology is always the same.</span><br/>
