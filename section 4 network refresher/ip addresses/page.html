<title>IP Adresses</title>
</head><body>command: ifconfig<br/>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">inet: my ip adress<br/>
inet6: my ipv6 adress<br/>
eigth bit . eight bit. eight bit = 32 bit therefore we have 2^32~= 4 billion range. so this is the motivation behind ipv6<br/>
companies buy this ip ranges and ISP buys from them and sells to you.<br/>
How to we use IPv4 despite the fact that our ip adresses run out? So our ip adresses (starts with 192,168 or 10.) is <b><u>private adresses</u></b>and these are not an ip adresss that is going to be out in the interweb. These adress is known only you.<br/>

<span style="font-size: 13pt">all devices we have use private ip adress in class a b or c well outside of this classes in loopback we have ip adresses which are bought by a company etc. and our private adresses is directed to our loopback ip adress. And this is the ip adress from interweb which has 4 billion range.</span><br/>

<span style="font-size: 13pt">ip adresses are layer 3 protocols and layer 3 is a router. So when we route traffic we route via an IP address.</span></body></html>
