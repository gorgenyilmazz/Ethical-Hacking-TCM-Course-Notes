<title>Scanning With Masscan</title>
</head><body>Mass scan was actually built to scan the entire internet really fast. It is a really fast port scanner.<br/>
<br/>
This is an Internet-scale port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second, from a single machine.<br/>
<br/>
we do not reccommend scan entire internet with masscan because, your door is knocked pretty quick.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes nmap is faster than masscan sometimes vice versa.<br/>

--rate is a speed factor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we can firstly find the open ports thetn we can scan as with -A with nmap<br/>
