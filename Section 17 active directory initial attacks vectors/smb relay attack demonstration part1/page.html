<br/>
now that we've triggered. let's look at ntlmxrelay <br/>
<img src="image 5.png"/><br/>
as we can see we got connecttion from fcastle machine and attacked peterparker machine(192.168.131.138) and we succeeded and we dumped hashes. Why do we succed on peterparker machine remember because frankcastle is a local admin on both machines. Now we can try to crack them and we can pass around these hashes. <br/>
<br/>
This is very common occurences especially if the environment has a lot of local admins and you have a lot of local admins on the same machine.<br/>
