Nmap stands for Network Mapping <br/>
<br/>
Nmap Stealth Scan (also known TCP SYN)<br/>
<br/>
This used to identify open ports and services. <br/>
<br/>
How to do this?<br/>
in normal with three hand shake these packets are sent SYN SYNACK ACK<br/>
in Stealth scan this become that ; SYN SYNACK RST because we dont want to estanblish a connection just are saying hi are you there?<br/>
<br/>
So as the name implies stealth scan should be stealthly. But if target's security system is good then they can detect the scan but most of times they couldn't detect.<br/>

<br/>
-T4 is a choice for speed. If speed was 1 (too slow) then detectability would raise. if speed was 5(most speed) then we might miss a port or information etc.<br/>
-p- this means that scan all of the ports (65535) if we say -p 80 then this would scan just port 80. if we don't write anything then it scans first 1000 ports.<br/>
-A meaning of that is scaning every aspects (OS detection , version detection) but OS information isn't accurate all the time.<br/>
Our job is look up and try to find exploit in these service's version etc.<br/>
<br/>
nmap -sU -T4 192.168.57.134 <br/>
this is udp scanning we got rid of -p- because there is not instant response time in udp so we would wait hours upon hours if we scan all the ports.<br/>
