<br/>
Another important thing to do is viewing source code.<br/>
<br/>
in source code we are looking for any kind of comments any kind of information disclosure. We might be looking for any sort of keys or password or user accounts or anything that might be disclosed in source code that should not be disclosed.<br/>
<br/>
