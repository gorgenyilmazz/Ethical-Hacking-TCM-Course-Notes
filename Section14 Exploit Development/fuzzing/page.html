<title>Fuzzing</title>
</head><body>Fuzzing is very similar to spiking in the sense that we're going to be sending a bunch of characters at a specific command and trying to break it.<br/>
<br/>
we've a script for that actually TCM has wrote that <br/>
<br/>
<img height="532" src="image.png" width="600"/><br/>
<br/>
we're trying to really narrow down where it's breaking and at what specific byte size<br/>
now we need to change mode of file for executing.(chmod +x fuzz.py)<br/>
<br/>
after that let's try to execute that<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 2.png"/><br/>
okey this worked. and look at that crashed at 5200 bytes.<br/>
<br/>
we can't actually overwrote the EIP that's fine we just need to know approximately where we crashed at.<br/>
So we'll just call it for even round numbers that we crashed somewhere around five thousand bytes.<br/>
<br/>
in the next video we're actually going to be finding where the EIP is at.<br/>
Controlling the EIP value is most important thing.<br/>
