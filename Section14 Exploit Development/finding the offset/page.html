<title>Finding the Offset</title>
</head><body>we're looking for where we overwrite the EIP that's what we want to control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so there's a tool for that<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image.png"/><br/>
<br/>
-l is from where we find the value in previous section which is 5200 and we chose 5200 because we want to guarantee that by giving 300 bytes more.<br/>
<br/>
and we take that value and send to vulnserver through findingoffset.py script.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 2.png"/><br/>
<br/>
and fire off<br/>
after the fire off we're getting the valuen in EIP through immunity debugger<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 3.png"/><br/>
<br/>
and there is another tool called pattern_offset<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 4.png"/><br/>
now with that byte(2003) we can control the EIP<br/>
<br/>
