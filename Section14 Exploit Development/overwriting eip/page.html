<title>Overwriting EIP</title>
</head><body>we found a value which is 2003 byte what that means is there's two thousand and three bytes right before you get to the EIP and the EIP itself is four bytes long. <br/>
<br/>
So we're going to try to do is overwrite those four specific bytes.<br/>
<br/>
let's write a script for that.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
now in that we are fill memory well into 2003 because it is starting point of EIP register. And then we're overwriting EIP with B (EIP is 4 byte) so in theory EIP should look like this 42424242 since ascii code of B is 42.<br/>
<br/>
we worked<br/>

<br/>
and immediately what should happen is happening<br/>

<br/>
what does it mean? it means we can control the EIP now.<br/>
