<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt">Password spraying is an attack that attempts to access a large number of accounts (usernames) with a few commonly used passwords. Traditional brute-force attacks attempt to gain unauthorized access to a single account by guessing the password. This can quickly result in the targeted account getting locked-out, as commonly used account-lockout policies allow for a limited number of failed attempts (typically three to five) during a set period of time. During a password-spray attack (also known as the “low-and-slow” method), the malicious actor attempts a single commonly used password (such as ‘Password1’ or ‘Summer2017’) against many accounts before moving on to attempt a second password, and so on. This technique allows the actor to remain undetected by avoiding rapid or frequent account lockouts.<br/>

</span></span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 12pt">Credential stuffing is the automated injection of stolen username (typically emails) and password pairs in order to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Using automation tools, large numbers of compromised credentials are automatically entered into an application (typically a Web application) until success is achieved. Once account takeover is achieved, account data can be stolen, fraudulent transactions initiated, or the account can be used for other nefarious activities.<br/>
